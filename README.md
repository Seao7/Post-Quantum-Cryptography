Shor’s Algorithm and Post Quantum Cryptography | Python, IBMQ, Dropbox API April-June 2023
• Explored Shor’s Algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, and its implications for cryptography.
• Implemented Learning with Errors (LWE), a prominent post-quantum cryptographic method, from scratch.
• Developed an understanding of LWE and its relevance in the context of post-quantum cryptography.
